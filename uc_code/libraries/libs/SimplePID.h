/*
 * This PID class uses code from the PID_V1 class. However, there are some important differences. Since we want to agree on the
 * whole -127 to 127 output thing, and a lecture of the encoders in the SAME terms, the input and output variables can be ints.
 * Also, to minimize the use of "spooky" action at distance with pointers, the compute method needs the lecture and the desired
 * value at each call. This also makes the code "timing unaware", in order to synchronize the encoder lecture taking and PID update,
 * the timing of the compute method IS LEFT to the outside methods. This is somewhat inconvenient, but I want to guarantee  deterministic
 * behavior and minimize the use of pointers and extra instructions in the loop.
 *
 * A get method can be used to retrieve the last calculated value. A setSampleTime method still exists AND MUST be set properly when
 * using the Ki or Kd parts.
 *
 * Output is limited to -127 to +127 by default and this is fixed in the code.
 *
 * Since this class tries to be bare-bones, I would recommend to set the desired value to the lecture value at the start of the sketch,
 * so the controller does not jumps or jerks. There is no manual mode either, and the controller direction is understood to be
 * ALWAYS positive. The encoder class can deal with sign fixing, and the talon, driver and servo class can be either changed in sign
 * with the constructor or swapping the connections to the motors.
